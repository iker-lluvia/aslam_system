# Turtlebot Autonomous Exploration (3D) 

Sorry I recently updated a wrong version of this. The bad repository was from Oct. 8th and now it's been fixed. Please let me know if you run into any issue with the current version.

## Overview

This is an ROS implementation of infomation-theoretic exploration using [turtlebot](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot) with a RGBD camera (e.g. Kinect). It is designed for autonomous mapping of indoor office-like environments (flat terrain). All the computation is performed on the turtlebot laptop and intermediate results can be viewed from remote PC. The output consist of both 2D and 3D [Octomap](http://octomap.github.io/) (.ot) file and saved on the turtlebot laptop.
Link to [wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_exploration_3d) (where you can find a video example.).


If you find this package useful, please consider citing the follow paper:

## How do I get set up? 


### Install Dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-octomap*
```


### Download from source:

```
my_catkin_workspace/src$ git clone 
my_catkin_workspace/src$ cd ..
my_catkin_workspace$ catkin_make
```


### Configure Network:
Please follow the [turtlebot network configuration](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Network%20Configuration) to setup.


### Running:

From Turtlebot:
```
$ roslaunch turtlebot_exploration_3d minimal_explo.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot_exploration_3d turtlebot_gmapping.launch
$ rosrun turtlebot_exploration_3d turtlebot_exploration_3d
```
* note: The octomap will be saved to the place where you do the "rosrun".


From Remote Server:
```
$ roslaunch turtlebot_exploration_3d exploration_rviz.launch
```
